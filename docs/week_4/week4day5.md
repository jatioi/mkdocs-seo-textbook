## Timing Considerations for New Businesses

If you're currently working on SEO for a website that isn't your future business but plan to use the same strategies, domain, or content for your future business, it might not be a good idea to fully implement it now.

**Why?**

* If you heavily optimize a site now and later change its purpose, branding, or content, search engines may take time to re-crawl and re-rank the new version
* If your current SEO efforts are linked to a different industry or niche, switching later could confuse search engines, affecting rankings
* Building authority for one purpose and then changing direction can result in a temporary ranking drop
