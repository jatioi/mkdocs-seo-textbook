# What is URL Structure?

A URL structure refers to how a website’s web addresses (URLs) are organized and formatted. A well-optimized URL structure improves SEO, user experience, and website navigation.

## Why is URL Structure Important for SEO?

**Improves Search Rankings** – Clean URLs help Google understand your page content.

**Boosts Click-Through Rate (CTR)** – Short, readable URLs attract more clicks.

**Enhances User Experience** – Visitors can easily navigate your site.


### Here’s the way on how to improve the Url

**Readability:** URLs should be easy to read and understand for both users and search engines. Avoid using long strings of random numbers or characters.

**Example:**  This text is <font color="red">www.example.com/healthy-breakfast-recipes</font>.

**Keywords:** Include relevant keywords in your URLs to improve search engine rankings and give users an idea of the page's content.

**Example:** <font color="red">www.example.com/vegan-breakfast-ideas</font>.

**Hyphens vs. Underscores:** Use hyphens to separate words in URLs, as search engines recognize hyphens as word separators. Avoid using underscores.

**Example:**

<font color="red">www.example.com/organic-cooking-tips (correct)</font>.

<font color="red">www.example.com/organic_cooking_tips (incorrect)</font>.

**Lowercase Letters:** Use lowercase letters in URLs to avoid potential issues with case sensitivity.
**Example:**

<font color="red">www.example.com/gardening-tools (correct)</font>.

<font color="red">www.example.com/Gardening-Tools (incorrect)</font>.


**Avoid Special Characters:** Avoid using special characters like &, %, $, @, etc., as they can cause issues with browsers and search engines.

**Example:** 

<font color="red">www.example.com/guide-to-yoga (correct)</font>.	

<font color="red">www.example.com/guide&to=yoga (incorrect)</font>.



## Choosing & Buying a Domain Name

## **What is a Domain?**
A **domain** is the unique web address (URL) that identifies a website on the internet. It is what users type into a browser to access a website.

For example, [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) is the domain for Google.

## **Components of a Domain Name**

A domain consists of different parts:

**Protocol:** <font color="#1600ff">**https://** </font> **(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** (Indicates a secure website)

**Subdomain:** <font color="#1600ff"> **www**. </font> **(World Wide Web)** (Optional, not always required)

**Domain Name:** <font color="#1600ff"> **google** </font> (Unique identifier)

**Top-Level Domain (TLD)**: <font color="#1600ff"> **.com** </font> (Also called domain extension)

**Example:** <font color="#1600ff"> https://www.example.com </font>

<font color="#1600ff"> **example** </font> = Domain name 

<font color="#1600ff"> **.com** </font> = TLD 


**It Helps Define Website Purpose**
- Different TLDs (Top level domain) indicate the type of website or its function.

Example: 

.com for commercial 

.gov for government websites 

.org for non-profits

.Store for Ecommerce business.


### Where is it usually seen?

A domain name is usually seen in the address bar of a web browser when visiting a website. It is part of a website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator). (Seen when visiting Google) Web Browser Address Bar.



### What is Hosting?
Hosting (Web Hosting) is a service that allows websites to be stored and accessed on the internet. It provides the necessary resources—such as servers, bandwidth, and storage space—to keep a website online and available to users.



A real-life example of web hosting is like renting a space for your store in a shopping mall.

Example:
Imagine you want to start an online clothing store. You need a place to store your products and display them to customers.
Web Hosting = The Store Space


Just like a mall rents out physical space for shops, a web hosting provider (like Bluehost, GoDaddy, or SiteGround) rents out server space for your website.
Domain Name = Store Address


Your website needs an address so people can find it (e.g., www.myclothingstore.com), just like a store has a physical address.
Website Files = Products & Store Design


Your website’s files (images, text, products) are like the clothing, shelves, and decorations inside your store.
Hosting Plan = Store Size & Features


If you expect high traffic (many visitors), you need a bigger hosting plan, just like a busy store needs more space or staff.


Things to Consider When Buying a Domain
Purchasing a domain is an essential step in building your online presence. Here the key factors to consider before buying a domain:
Choose a Memorable & Brandable Name
1.) Keep it short, simple, and easy to remember.
2.) Avoid numbers, hyphens, and confusing spellings.
