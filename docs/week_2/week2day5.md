### **Step 1: Define Background for a Website**


#### 1. Use a common background color for all images in website articles.
#### 2. Ensure consistency in background color across all images.
#### 3. You can either:

### **Step 2: Define Position for the Logo**
There are three possible placements for the website/brand logo in images:

**Option A:**

### **Step 3: Define Icons and Graphics**
 1. Identify the topic of the article.
 2. Find relevant images or icons that match the topic.
 3. If no specific images/icons fit, use a general image that aligns with the content.

### **Step 4: Write Captions for Images**
1. Prioritize H2 headings from the article as the caption for images.
2. Ensure captions are placed below the image for clarity.
3. Maintain a reasonable frequency of images throughout the content.

### **Step 5: Design the Thumbnail Image**
1. For page posts and category posts, the first image should be the featured image.
2. The caption for the featured image should be taken from the postâ€™s title.
