## **What Are Header Tags?**
Header tags (H1-H6) structure a webpage, making it easier for search engines and users to read and navigate the content. 

## **Why Are Header Tags Important?**
### **Improve SEO Rankings**

Search engines like Google use header tags to determine the relevance and structure of a page. A well-optimized H1 tag with target keywords can improve rankings.

### **Enhance Readability & User Experience**

Headers break up content, making it easier to read and navigate. Users can quickly find the information they need, reducing bounce rates.

### **Help with Accessibility**

Screen readers rely on header tags to help visually impaired users navigate content easily.

### **Organize Content for Better Engagement**

A well-structured page encourages longer reading sessions, signaling to Google that the content is valuable.

## **Header Tag** 

### Each header tag has a specific purpose:

```
