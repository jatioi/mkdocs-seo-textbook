## **3 ways how search engine works:**

### **Crawling**

- Crawling is the process by which search engine bots or spiders scan your website's web pages to determine their content and relevance.
 
These bots follow links from one page to another, collecting information about websites.
Why is crawling important?

Crawling is essential because it enables search engines to understand your website's content and relevance. If a web page isn't crawled, it won't appear in search engine results pages, making it difficult for potential users to find you.




### **Indexing**
Indexing is the process where search engines like Google store and organize web pages after crawling them. Once a page is indexed it can appear in search engine result pages, The primary goal of indexing is to ensure that a website's content can appear in search results when users search for relevant keywords. If a page is not indexed, it won't appear in search results.

### **Ranking** 
"Ranking" is the process of arranging website links, items, people, or entities in a specific order based on a set of criteria, such as quality, performance, importance, or preference. It indicates relative positions, such as first, second, third, etc.

When a user searches for something, search engines rank the indexed pages based on relevance and quality.

## **Google's algorithm considers 200+ ranking factors**

Google's algorithm is a set of rules that determines how to rank websites in search results. It's a complex system that uses many different algorithms, and it's constantly changing.

Keyword relevance – Does the page match the search query?
Backlinks – Are other websites linking to it?
Page speed & mobile-friendliness – Does it load fast and work on phones?
Freshness – Is the content recent and updated?

### Why its important?
Staying updated with Google's algorithm changes helps SEO professionals and website owners optimize content and avoid penalties, ensuring better rankings and visibility.
